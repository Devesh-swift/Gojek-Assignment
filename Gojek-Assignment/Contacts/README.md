## Contacts Application

Contacts app is similar to the iOS Contacts app but with a much smaller feature set like show, add and edit contacts.\

I have followed MVVM architecture to build this application.

## Requirements

1. Xcode 11
2. Swift 5
3. iOS 10.0+

## Getting Started

1. Open `Contacts.xcodeproj` in Xcode 11.
2. To Build and Run, select any of the iPhone simulators or a connected device.

## Unit and UI Test cases

* Total number of test cases - `55`
* Unit test cases - `47`
* UI test cases - `8`
* Code coverage - `89.6%`

## Running the tests

Use command &#8984; + U to run the UI and Unit test cases.

## External Frameworks

Not used any of the 3rd party frameworks.
